# A "minimal" Windows GUI application to graph network latency.

## Motivation

I couldn't find any tool to easily identify intermittent network connection issues. My current place of residence has had recent issues with connection stability, and I wanted a tool to see latency spikes in real-time when performing latency sensitive tasks.

## Showcase

## Status

The code base is very rushed and probably full of bugs. I put this together in about an hour, without following any good structure.
