Match registers for microcode. Fuzzed for Zen 4 Ryzen 7000 series using [zentool](https://github.com/google/security-research/tree/master/pocs/cpus/entrysign/zentool). This link may die in the future, if it does and you would like the file, feel free to message me.

This file was quite the process to produce. Took 3 days of babysitting my crashing system. I hope that this helps someone avoid that process.
